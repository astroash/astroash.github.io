## Welcome to my Application README


This website has been created as part of the application process for [Founders &amp; Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/)' full stack developer course.

**The criteria for the site:**
* One Page **_tick_**
* No Bootstrap **_tick_**
* No jQuery **_Uh ohh.._** (oops, this wasn't here when I first started!)

My site is kindly hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), API supplied by [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and newspaper alignment aided by [Media Bias Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/).
